## Oi

Hello world. Honestly that phrase is my favorite thing to see sometimes. It never gets old. 
But seriously though. How are you doing world. This is the first post from this sick likkle blog that I want to spin up. I think I'm mostly going to talk about my journey switching careers into tech and all the fun little things I learn from here on out. I also want a place to talk about the little side project I want to play with. Like this lil Astro 4 blog, GO-Lang hits, and some good ol' full stackitiy stack web dev. 

TTYL
